# IbPy Native - Interactive Brokers Native Python API

## Installation
Install from PyPI
```sh
pip install ibpy-native
```

Alternatively, install from source. Execute `setup.py` from the root directory.
```sh
python setup.py install
```

__*Always use the newest version while the project is still in alpha!*__

## Usage
```python
import ibpy_native
import pytz

# Set the timezone to match the timezone specified in TWS or IB Gateway when login
# Default timezone - 'America/New_York'
ibpy_native.IBBridge.set_timezone(pytz.timezone('America/New_York'))


# Connect to a running TWS or IB Gateway instance
bridge = ibpy_native.IBBridge(host='127.0.0.1', port=4001, client_id=1, auto_conn=True)
```

An optional parameter `timeout` is available for all APIs implemented in 
`IBBridge`. The timeout value is treated as `X` seconds, and the default timeout 
time has been set to 10 seconds.

```python
# Search the US stock contract of Apple Inc.
aapl = bridge.get_us_stock_contract(symbol='AAPL')

# Ask for the earliest available data point of AAPL
head_time = bridge.get_earliest_data_point(contract=aapl, data_type='TRADES')

# Get all historical ticks of AAPL
#
# It's better to set the timeout value a bit long (e.g. 30~100s) as this API 
# loops to request around 1000 historical ticks for each IB API request due to 
# IB's limitation. IB will slow down the response time after the first 10~20 
# requests, thus the default 10s timeout is likely to be insufficient to wait 
# for the following API responses from IB.
ticks = bridge.get_historical_ticks(contract=aapl, data_type='TRADES', timeout=100)
```

Scripts in `cmd` folder are designed provide instant access to some functions 
implemented in `ibpy_native`. You can simply run the Python scripts in virtual 
environment to make use of them.
```sh
# Make sure you are at root directory of the package before calling pipenv to 
# run the script or enter the virtual environment, as it will load the .env 
# file which adds the current directory path to PYTHONPATH.
pipenv shell

# e.g. fetch all historical ticks of YM 2020 MAR contract
python cmd/fetch_us_historical_ticks.py YM fut 202003
```
Other options for the scripts can be found by using the `-h` or `--help` flags.

## System requirements
- Python >= 3.5; Pervious versions are not supported (development is based on 
Python 3.7.7)
- _Included IB API version - `9.79.01`_

## Development status (a.k.a. Words from developers)
Although the project is under the stage of active development, up until now
(ver. 0.1.1) it focuses on retrieving historical ticks for stock & future
contracts from IB. Other security types (e.g. options) may work but those are
not yet tested.

Other features like retrieving account details, place & modify orders are
planned to be implemented in the future, but there is no estimated timeline for 
those atm, as the project is being developed alongside Devtography internal 
algo-trading program. For now, the features will be developed and released when 
needed.
